# MDX Demo

This page is written in MDX and can use React components inline.

<Admonition type="info" title="Custom Component">
  This uses the Admonition component exported by our MDX components mapping.
</Admonition>

You can also write plain Markdown:

- Works with GFM
- Renders tables, code, etc.

\`\`\`bash
echo "Hello from MDX!"
\`\`\`
